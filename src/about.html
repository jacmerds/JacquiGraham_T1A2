                <h3>Why i'm interested in web dev</h3>
                <p>After trying many different courses and various industries, I have been inspired to follow a career in web development by a friend currently in the industry and through my own research into coding. I have always been interested in problem solving and creative work, so I am naturally enjoying both of these aspects through my studies at Coder Academy. I chose the Coder Academy bootcamp because I have heard great reviews about the course content, teachers and how they prepare you for a real career in the industry The short and intensive length of the course is a positive as I will learn these skills quickly and can enter the industry in less than a year. I am looking forward to the hard work and fun of learning more about web development and what this career will bring me.</p>

                <h3>Experience</h3> 
                <p>Having a background in customer service, design and healthcare, this gives me a huge range of skills that I can bring to my studies and future work as a web developer. I am able to work within a team easily to collaborate on projects and tasks to achieve great results. I have great written, verbal and non-verbal skills that allow me to understand my colleagues and customers to ensure the correct outcome is achieved in the best way possible. At the completion of the Coder Academy bootcamp I will achieve a Diploma of Information Technology and be competent as a Full Stack Developer.</p>

                <h3>Interests/hobbies</h3>
                <p>Aside from learning to code now, I have many interests and love trying something new. Travelling is a love of mine, and I look forward to doing more in the future. I love visiting interesting places, sometimes off the beaten track and enjoy being immersed in another culture. Learning to cook authentic food is something I love to do in other countries, as you can see in my photo where I recently visited Thailand.</p> 
                <p>I love being outdoors and exploring different areas, either spending time at the beach or taking a bush walk. I enjoy staying active whether it is yoga, running, snorkelling (one day I’ll learn to dive) or roller skating. I’m an ex-roller derby player too!</p>
                <p>I also spend my time reading and trying new ways to be creative such as drawing, painting, pottery/clay sculpture and crafts.</p>
